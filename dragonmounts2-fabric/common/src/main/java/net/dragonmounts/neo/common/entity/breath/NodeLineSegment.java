/**
 * Created by TGG on 31/07/2015.
 * NodeLineSegment is used to represent a spherical node which has moved from one [x,y,z] point to a second [x,y,z] point.
 * Each line segment has a start point and a finish point.  The node has a defined radius.
 * The line segment is then used to detect collisions with other objects
 * <p>
 * Optionally, the segment
 * can be provided with a collection of collisions as well (each collision corresponds to an AABB which is known to
 * overlap with a block or entity, as discovered while moving the node.  the facing shows which face of the node
 * collided with the object.)
 * Typical usage:
 * (1) create node segment with a start point, finish point, and node radius.  Optional collisions from entity moving.
 * (2) collisionCheckAABB(), collisionCheckAABBcorners(), addStochasticCloud() and/or addBlockCollisions() to
 * perform collision checks of the against the node against blocks or entities

     * Creates a cloud of points around the line segment, to simulate the movement of a sphere starting from the
     * beginning of the line segment and moving to the end.  Each point is mapped onto the world grid.
     * Uses stochastic simulation, each point is generated as
     * 1) a point [x1,y1,z1] is chosen along the line segment, evenly distributed according to the number of cloud points,
     * plus a small random jitter
     * 2) a random point [x2,y2,z2] is chosen within the sphere centred on [x1,y1,z1].  This is generated from spherical
     * coordinates radius, phi, theta, uniformly distributed.  This puts more points near the centre of the sphere
     * i.e. the density of points is highest in the centre which is roughly what we want.
     * Each call to addStochasticCloud adds a total of totalDensity to the world grid -
     * eg if totalDensity = 1.0, it adds 1.0 to a single location, or 0.2 to location 1 and 0.8 to location 2, etc
     * Then:
     * For each of the direct collisions for this node (overlaps between the node AABB and the world, as calculated
     * in the entity movement), increment the hit density of the corresponding blocks
     * (The collision may have been caused by an entity not the blocks, however if the block actually has nothing in
     * it then it won't be affected anyway.)
