/**
 * Created by TGG on 7/08/2015.
 * * Models an entity which is being affected by the breath weapon
 * Every tick that an entity is exposed to the breath weapon, its "hit density" increases.
 * Keeps track of the number of ticks that the entity has been exposed to the breath.
 * Typical usage:
 * 1) Create a new BreathAffectedEntity for the entity
 * 2) Each time it is hit, call addHitDensity() proportional to the exposure + strength of the weapon
 * 3) Every tick, call decayEntityEffectTick
 * <p>
 * Query the entity's damage by
 * 1) getHitDensity
 * 2) isUnaffected
 * 3) each tick: if applyDamageThisTick() is true, apply the weapon damage now.  (This is used to space out the
 * damage so that armour doesn't protect so much (eg 20 damage delivered once per second instead of 1 damage
 * delivered twenty times per second - (a player with armour is invulnerable to that)  )
